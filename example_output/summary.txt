**Role Roadmap**
The Vibe Coder-in-Residence (GenAI Tech EA) is a high-impact role that supports the VP of Edge AI. The first 6 months are divided into three phases:

- **Day 1-30: Observe → Automate**
  - Shadow the VP to capture friction points
shiv micro-agents that cut repeat tasks (e.g., LLM-powered agenda generator, decision-tracker bot)
- **Day 31-60: Scale → Compose**
  - Chain agents together to optimize calendar and meetings
  - Instrument agents with telemetry to reduce human touchpoints by >25%
  - Build a microsite "tech radar" and a "team tracker" agent
- **Day 61-90: Externalize → Evangelize**
  - Package agents as internal templates
  - Produce a public demo or open-sourced repo
  - Partner with Comms for media drops
- **Month 4-6: Digital Twin v1**
  - Fine-tune a personal-style LLM and mult-agent fabric
  - Draft briefs and strategic emails in the VP's style
  - Achieve a formal Turing evaluation with ≥ 70% confusion goal

**Daily Responsibilities**
- Live-code GenAI agents in Python/TypeScript using LangChain, OpenAI, etc.
- Fine-tune and orchestrate LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, local models)
- Rapidly engineer prompts and optimize systems prompts for VP agents
- Integrate with enterprise APIs (Teams, Confluence, Office)
- Maintain a "metrics or it didn't happen" dashboard (latency, adoption, minutes saved)
- Co-write technical blogs and demo scripts with Comms to amplify the story

**Key Candidate Qualifications**
- **Must-Haves:**
  - Track record of shipping GenAI products in < 2 weeks cycles
  - Mastery of GenAI and agent frameworks (Langchain, MCP, etc.)
  - Rapid full-stack micro-site builder (e.g., Vercel)
  - Comfortable pair-programming or pair-prompting in a fast-moving exec environment
  - Storytelling chops to turn changelogs into headlines
  - Ability to work in the CA time zone (primarily)
- **Nice-to-Haves:**
  - Experience reverse-engineering personal workflows or building AI copilots
  - Familiarity with productivity hacks and coding them as agents
  - Prior startup founding engineer or hacker-in-residence cred
  - Familiarity with enterprise security & compliance for LLM rollouts

**Success Metrics**
- ≥ 5 production agents live by day 30
- ≥ 30% reduction in VP calendar load by day 90
- ≥ 2 external media features or conference demos by month 6
