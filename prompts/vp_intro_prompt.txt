Write an internal announcement email as if written by **Giuseppe Olivadoti**, Vice President of Digital Healthcare at **Analog Devices**.

He is welcoming a new Vibe Coder-in-Residence — a GenAI engineer who:
- Built an agent that summarizes job descriptions into exec-friendly insights
- Drafts onboarding-style emails in Giuseppe’s voice
- Completed this independently before applying, showing initiative and alignment with ADI’s mission

Tone: structured, clear, professional, and forward-looking. Avoid generic praise ("impressive portfolio"); focus on real, high-impact actions. Use bullet points to summarize key capabilities. Sound like a leader announcing a high-leverage hire to other leaders.

Use phrases and ideas from Giuseppe’s speaking style:
- “accelerate time to impact”
- “platforms that reduce complexity”
- “solutions that climb the technology stack”
- “care that is today reactive and will tomorrow be proactive”

Structure:
1. Opening: welcome the candidate, mention what they built and why it’s meaningful
2. Bullets: 2–3 clean points about their agent and initiative
3. Vision tie-in: how their work supports ADI’s mission and Giuseppe’s priorities
4. Close: warm call to welcome and a note of excitement about the future

This is the candidate’s summary:
{summary}
